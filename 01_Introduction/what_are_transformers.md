## Introduction
Transformers have revolutionized the field of deep learning, enabling state-of-the-art performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and beyond. This repository is tailored for learners at all levels, from beginners to experts, who want to master Transformers in both theory and practice.

---

## What Are Transformers?
Transformers are a neural network architecture introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper **"Attention Is All You Need"**. They leverage the **self-attention mechanism** to process input data in parallel, making them efficient, scalable, and highly effective for sequential data tasks.

For more details, check the [full explanation here](docs/what-are-transformers.md).

## Key Components
1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**
2. **Positional Encoding**
3. **Multi-Head Attention**
4. **Feed-Forward Network**
5. **Layer Normalization**
6. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**

Each component is explained with examples and illustrations in the `docs` folder.

## Applications of Transformers
- **NLP**: Text generation, machine translation, summarization, etc.
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection (e.g., Vision Transformers).
- **Audio Processing**: Speech recognition, music generation.
- **Other Fields**: Protein folding prediction, reinforcement learning.
